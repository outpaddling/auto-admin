Usage: $0 [--help] [--extract-only] [boostrap-flags]

The following bootstrap flags are generated by auto-dreckly-setup:

    --abi
    --unprivileged
    --prefix
    --pkgdbdir
    --sysconfdir
    --varbase
    --prefer-pkgsrc=yes
    --workdir

Any arguments to auto-dreckly-setup besides --help or --extract-only are
passed directly to the dreckly boostrap script, after the flags listed
above.

umask should generally be 0022 for dreckly bootstrap and package builds to
ensure that most files are world-readable and certain private files are

since you will have to know about special permissions on all files that
require them.

You MUST have the following Cygwin packages installed:

    devel/gfortran
    devel/make
    lib/mpfr (required by gcc, but not installed automatically)
    net/curl or web/wget

Ideally, no other Cygwin packages should be installed.  Libraries and tools
installed by Cygwin could be found and used by configure scripts in dreckly
packages.  As with all package systems, It is better if all dreckly
dependencies are installed by dreckly.  Dreckly does its best to ensure that
this happens, but configure scripts have minds of their own and dreckly cannot
control them completely.

Auto-dreckly-setup handles multiple installations under the same parent by
appending the date of a current snapshot or the name of a quarterly snapshot.

It is recommended that you use an install suffix unless you are sure that
you will not need another dreckly tree under

# Base compiler setup

============================================================================
You will need at least a C compiler and a C++ compiler to build most
dreckly packages.  Many packages also require a Fortran compiler.  On
many systems, such as NetBSD, dreckly can build its own Fortran compilers.
On RHEL/CentOS, using the gfortran compiler provided via Yum works well.

If dreckly is bootstrapped to use the GCC compiler collection,
it will look for gfortran in the PATH when building certain packages.

Compiling with -march=native can result in executables that run up to 30%
faster in some cases, though usually less.  The binary packages created
will not be portable, however, and will only run on CPUs with all the
same features as this one.

If you are using this system to generate binary packages for use on other
systems, answer 'n' here.

If you want executables optimized for maximum speed on this system, answer
'y'.  This will append -march=native to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and FFLAGS in

    $sys_dir/etc/mk.conf

You can add additional compiler flags here as well, all of which will be
applied to every dreckly build.

If you would like to use a dreckly GCC compiler to build most packages
(all but GCC itself), enter the major version number below.  The major
version is the number following "gcc" in the list of packages below.

This should only be necessary if the native compiler is very old, which
may be the case for older versions of Enterprise Linux, etc.

If you want to use the native compiler rather than a dreckly GCC package,
just press enter.  The native compiler should work fine for most
modern operating systems.

Available gcc packages:

certificates automatically.  Instead, it is left to the user to decide which
certificates should be trusted.

Among the most common lists of trusted certificates are those published by
Mozilla.  These are available as the following dreckly packages:

    security/mozilla-rootcerts
    security/mozilla-rootcerts-openssl

Note that these packages include certificates that are required for full
functionality in curl, git, install.packages() in the R language, and
possibly other programs you will install via dreckly.

They can be installed at any time, but doing it now might prevent problems
for all users of this system.

********************************** WARNING **********************************

The bmake binaries installed by dreckly are patched to install packages under
the PREFIX of the tree in which they are built, regardless of the current
working directory from which you run them.  For example, if you run
/usr/pkg-2020Q3/bin/bmake from /usr/dreckly-2019Q1, it will build packages
from /usr/dreckly-2019Q1 and install them under /usr/pkg-2020Q2.

This will likely cause serious problems, largely due to incompatible versions
of dependency packages.  It is therefore critical to ensure that your PATH is
always correct for the tree in which you are building.

It is strongly recommended that you use "safe-bmake" or the abbreviation
"sbmake" to build and install dreckly packages.  This wrapper, automatically
generated by auto-dreckly-setup, performs a simple check to ensure that you
are using the correct bmake binary for the tree in which you are building.

Users running sh-compatible shells can use the following to configure the
environment for this installation:

    . ${sys_dir}/etc/dreckly.sh

Users running csh-compatible shells can use the following:

    source ${sys_dir}/etc/dreckly.csh

On systems with the "module" command, users can use the following instead
of one of the commands above:

    module load ${sys_dir}/etc/modulefiles/dreckly/${dist_suffix#-}

To install a package, type:

    cd $dreckly_dir/<category>/<package>
    safe-bmake install

Ex.
    cd $dreckly_dir/math/blas
    safe-bmake install

After setting the environment using one of the commands above, to compile
and link programs using libraries installed by dreckly, use:

    -I\$DRECKLY_INCLUDE
    -L\$DRECKLY_LIB

Ex. Assuming your Makefile uses CFLAGS for compiling and LFLAGS for link:

    make CFLAGS="-Wall -g -I\$DRECKLY_INCLUDE" LFLAGS="-L\$DRECKLY_LIB"

You can keep your dreckly tree up-to-date by periodically running the
following commands:

    cd $dreckly_dir
    cvs -q update -dP

The devel/scmcvs package provides a cvs command in case your system does
not already have one.

To update your installed packages after a cvs update, there are tools such
as

    pkgtools/pkg_check
    pkgtools/pkg_rolling-replace

If there are binary packages for this installation, you may also be able to
use

    pkgin upgrade
