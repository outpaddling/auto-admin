Users may need to install some ports/packages from source even though they use
binary packages for most installs, because some ports/packages cannot be
distributed in binary form for licensing reasons, to build with non-default
options, or to build with non-portable optimizations (e.g. -march=native).

Tagging a port/package for installation from source here will inform
auto-update-system that it should be rebuilt from source following package
upgrade and ports/pkgsrc tree updates.

To avoid compatibility issues, you must ensure that your ports/pkgsrc tree
and installed packages are in sync.  This can be generally be ensured by using
auto-update-system (first option in this menu), which ensures that your
ports/pkgsrc tree and binary package are on the same branch, and updates
them together.

Note that using latest binary packages on some platforms may make it
impossible to keep them in sync, because latest binary packages are not built
regularly.  Hence, the binary package may be far behind the current source
tree.  On FreeBSD and NetBSD amd64, latest packages are built continuously
and generally lag behind ports by no more than a few days.  Hence, mixing on
amd64 is very safe as long as the ports/pkgsrc tree and installed packages
are up-to-date.

Mixing quarterly ports/pkgsrc and binary packages is generally safe since
versions never change except in very rare cases to resolve serious issues.
Binary packages are generally rebuilt quickly after such updates to ensure
compatibility.

If building with non-default options, you must ensure that the build is
compatible with dependent ports/packages.  (This is an issue whether mixing
source builds and binary packages or building everything from source.)

Occasionally an important port becomes broken and running package upgrades
will remove it from your system as a result. This is almost never an issue
with quarterly packages, but is something you will likely experience
eventually if using latest packages.  

Tagging a package as critical informs auto-update-system that you would like
to be notified that this package is missing from the repository before
proceeding with ports and package upgrades.  Generally these issues are fixed
within quickly, so simply holding off on upgrades for a while is the easiest
solution.

Desktop-installer automatically tags certain packages, such as the chosedn
desktop environment or window manager, xorg, etc.
